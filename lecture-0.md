# Organization

Research is a web of themes. Theme is a series of deltas emerging with new 
papers comparing to old papers. Theme can't go over 100 papers -- then it becomes
a huge monster (e.g. types, gradual typing, etc.).

## Submission

1. To Jan 13 we have to supply 3-5 ideas for a first theme. The instuctor will 
write back which theme to chose.

2. Select ~10 papers, read introductions.
